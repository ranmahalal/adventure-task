# AI Exercise Generator - Limitations and Trade-offs

## API Dependencies

### OpenAI API Cost Requirements

**Limitation**: Each topic generation requires approximately $0.005 in OpenAI credits.


### Unsplash Rate Limits

**Limitation**: Free tier limited to 1000 requests per hour.


## Technical Constraints

### No Offline Functionality

**Limitation**: Application requires internet connection for core features.

**Trade-offs**:
- Simplified architecture without offline data management
- Reduced complexity in data synchronization
- Limited user experience in poor connectivity scenarios

**Impact**:
- Users cannot access previously generated exercises offline
- No cached exercise content available without network
- Background images not available offline

### LocalStorage-Only Persistence

**Limitation**: All data stored locally in browser storage.

**Trade-offs**:
- No server-side database required
- Data not shared across devices or browsers
- Limited storage capacity (typically 5-10MB)


### Single-User Design

**Limitation**: No user authentication or multi-user support.

**Trade-offs**:
- Simplified architecture without user management
- No data isolation between users
- No user-specific customization or preferences


### No Caching Layer for API Responses

**Limitation**: No server-side caching of OpenAI responses.

**Trade-offs**:
- Simplified backend architecture
- Higher API costs for repeated requests
- Slower response times for duplicate topics

**Impact**:
- Same topic generates new exercises each time
- Increased OpenAI API usage and costs
- No optimization for popular topics


## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Database Integration**: Add PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data persistence
2. **User Authentication**: Implement JWT-based user management
3. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis for API response caching
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting and abuse protection
5. **Offline Support**: Add service worker for offline functionality
6. **Monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring and logging
7. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
